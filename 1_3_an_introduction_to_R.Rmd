## Important Note

If you downloaded and installed R in a location other than the United States, you might encounter some formatting issues later in this class due to language differences. To fix this, you will need to type in your R console:

Sys.setlocale("LC_ALL", "C")
This will only change the locale for your current R session, so please make a note to run this command when you are working on any lectures or exercises that might depend on the English language (for example, the names for the days of the week).

```{r cars}
Sys.setlocale("LC_ALL", "C")
```
